Objective

This program will allow the user to play hangman against the computer using a list of words from a txt file.
-Functio  that randomly selecs a word from the text dictionary
-Funtion that takes imput from the user which will be the letter guessed
-Funtion that will take the letter guessed correctly and turn them into a string    
-Need to create various variables to store the users inputted data 
    -variable for the word that the computer picks
    -Create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed right by the user
-We need to display an intro to the program
-Build a repetative system, so that the user can keep guessing letters
-If the user guesses wrong, a new part of the body is drawn, until they loose. (Guess lets goes down/ wrong guesses goes up)
- add statements at the end and beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
